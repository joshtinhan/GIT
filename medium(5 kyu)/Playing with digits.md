# Question:Playing with digits
Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p

we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.
In other words:

Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k

If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.
```JavaScript
digPow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
digPow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k
digPow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
digPow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
```

## Sample Tests
```JavaScript
Test.assertEquals(digPow(89, 1), 1)
Test.assertEquals(digPow(92, 1), -1)
Test.assertEquals(digPow(46288, 3), 51)
```
## Answer
```JavaScript
function digPow(n, p){
  let num = Array.from(n.toString());
  // turn n into an array like ["8","9"]
  let sum = (acc,cur,i) => acc + Math.pow(cur,i+p)
  // acc = 8^p + 9^(p+1) since i was counted from 0
  return num.reduce(sum,0)/n%1 == 0 ? num.reduce(sum,0)/n : -1 //if there's an integer then return, or return -1
}
```
